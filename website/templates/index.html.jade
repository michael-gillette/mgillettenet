          p
            | Formerly Zojo Media. At Now Build I managed a suite of e-commerce websites running on 
            a(href="http://www.cabinethub.com", target="_blank") Magento 
            | and 
            a(href="http://www.cabinetnow.com", target="_blank") Virtuemart
            | . I implemented the Magento SOAP service in two major ways. The first, a shipping status update webapp. The second, 
            a(href="http://www.cabinethub.com/hinge-configurator", target="_blank") a hinge configurator

            a(href="http://www.fastfaucet.com", target="_blank") FastFaucet.com 
            | I architected and developed a product data collection engine 
            | internally called Eskumo. Eskumo is built on Google App Engine with Python and was the key to managing the 14k products on the website.
          p
            | I worked with our team to design and develop the BuildSmart app, a price finding application, using TriggerIO.

          p
            | MarketFleet's value proposition was a marketplace platform for retailers and resellers. 
            | I designed and developed the Seller Portal for the Betty Mills white labeled product. 
            | I wrote the API documentation and created tutorial videos on interacting with the platform. I wrote the API examples for Python, PHP, and Ruby. 
            | 
          p
            | I managed the FTP service for uploading files on Compute Engine and wrote a PyDaemon script to monitor changes to run an import. For a more managed service I wrote a Django/Celery webservice for clients without FTP. The largest client we had provided a catalog with 800k products.

          p
            | I worked with an international team to build an analyzer of SEC public filings. 
            | We built the web application using Django on AppEngine with Django-NonRel and the MapReduce library.
          p
            | By redefining the model relationships to fit a NoSQL schema I reduced the import of the 1.5gb feed from 8 hours and $40, to 45 minutes and $5. A by-product of this was the page load time on the Earnings Analyzer webview going from 15 seconds to 3.5 seconds. 
          p
            | I worked with the Founder to produce the Earnings Analyzer view. A user would enter a stock symbol then navigate the analyzed data via tables and graphs to make informed investment decisions.

            .sub.header Software Developer - November 2009 to February 2011
          p
            | I started as an intern on the Auctiva Marketplace Platform team. After 3 months Auctiva offered me a Junior Frontend Developer position on the same team. From the Chico office I coordinated with the San Mateo office to build the Product Page and Checkout Flow on Elefy, an AMP storefront. During this time I learned to use the ASP.NET MVC platform.
          p
            | I started in Python and Google App Engine with Auctiva's Shipping Insurance app for the eBay 3rd party seller platform. I also assisted the AuctionSniper and BuyShield teams, frontend and backend. Because of this additional experience Auctiva promoted me to Software Developer.
          p
            | When Auctiva transitioned me to the core Auctiva product I worked on Auctiva.com, and Auctiva Commerce. At the end of my time at Auctiva I was working on a way to localize an entire ASP.NET web application.
